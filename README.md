# Daniel_Gao_HCDE310_Final
For the final project, I built a recipe generator using the Spoonacular API.
The recipe generator can generate 10 recipes according to the ingredient you type in.
When you decide to cook at home but do not know what dishes to cook from the ingredients you have from your fridge, this app can help!
